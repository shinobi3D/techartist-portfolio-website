# Eye Deformation Using SkinWeights, sine and cos

I came across [this article](https://rigmarolestudio.com/rigging-spherical-eyes/) and thought this was a cool concept to try out. I was able to get something going, but I'll have to give it more resolution in my next run.

This setup took me about a day to figure out and hook up. I'll post a more thorough update about the process soon.
