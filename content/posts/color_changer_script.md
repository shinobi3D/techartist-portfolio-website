![Color Changer](/images/colorChanger_script.jpg)

Color Changer is an updated python version of a mel script(edmxColorChanger.mel) I've been using in my workflow. I also took this as a challenge to build a gui using cmds. I also added the ability to easily change the color on the shape of the control.
