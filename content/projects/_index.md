 I was really excited to find out that our team over at Sinkin Ship Ent. won the Emmy for best VFX on a children's show.  I worked on a number of rigs for this produciton, about 6 or 7 of the animals featured throughout the episodes. Including the Bees, Dragonfly, Shark, Polar Bear, and Flying Fox.  One of the great perks of working on this project was the anatomy lessons from Stuart Sumida, the film industries leading animal anatomy expert.

I worked really hard to complete the full rig for the Cowarldy Lion character. This rig was a challenge because I was tasked with overhauling our studios current facial setup for one that was more adherent to FACS system. I really pushed my knowledge with this setup and was able to provide more accurate face shapes and secondary controls for the animators. This work can be seen in my [demo reel](https://anthonylynch.xyz/reel)

I was on this show briefly early on during my time at Sinking Ship Ent. I was responsible for completing initial setups for the 4 main characters. That included body and facial setup. Its quite something to see where the rest of the team was able to take this monster(in size) of a show.
