 I was really excited to find out that our team over at Sinkin Ship Ent. was nominiated and won the Emmy for best VFX on a children's show.  I worked on a number of rigs for this produciton, about 6 or 7 of the animals featured throughout the episodes. Including the Bees, Dragonfly, Shark, Polar Bear, and Flying Fox.  One of the great perks of working on this project was the anatomy lessons from the consultant whos name escapes me right now. Access to some of his anatomical and evolutionary knowledge helped push the final product.

I worked really hard to complete the full rig for the Cowarldy Lion character. This rig was a challenge because I was tasked with overhauling our studios current facial setup for one that was more adherent to FACS system. I really pushed my knowledge with this setup and was able to provide more accurate face shapes and secondary controls for the animators.
