 I was really excited to find out that the team over at Sinkin Ship Ent. was nominiated and won the Emmy for best VFX on a children's show.  I worked on a number of rigs for this produciton, about 6 or 7 of the animals featured in each episode. This included Bees, Dragonfly, Shark, Polar Bear, and Flying Fox.

I worked really hard to complete the full rig for the Cowarldy Lion character.
