## Why
I've always wanted to create my own book prop rig, but was never really tasked with doing so when I was on productions.  Usually it would be a simple book, that never had to open or be interacted with. I never got to flex the rigging chops, but now that I have the time I'm making it a point. 

I've researched all the best book rigs i could find, and will be trying to mimic behaviour and features that I think are best.
