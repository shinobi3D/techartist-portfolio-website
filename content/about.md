## About

I've been in the animation industry for 10+ years and a rigger for more then 8. I really enjoy the gratifcaiton I get from solving complex problems. I've recently gained an interest in software dev and how these tools can help VFX produciton.  I'm currently using 
- vim
- pycharm
- git/bash
- obsidian
- maya, blender, ue5

And trying to improve my workflow everyday.
