I've been an Animation Industry Professional for over 10 years, and spent a majority of that time as a Rigging Artist working on projects from Animation to VFX. I specialize in creating rigging systems using python and various DCC software. I pride myself in providing animators with flexible and responsive rigs. And I really enjoy the gratifcaiton I get from solving technical problems.
