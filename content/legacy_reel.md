### Animation Rigging Reel Breakdown 
**Elena of Avalor ( Disney )**
- Responsible for helping rig Jaquins( flying lions ) using Vetala. I rigged the body and some aspects of the face. I was also tasked with completing the wing setup after the artist who began this setup left during production.
- Rigged body and facial for some of the generic Noblin creatures.

**Tossed In Space ( Pilot )**
- Responsible for the face and body setup of the pilot and some of the Generals using Anzovin Rig Tools.

**Abby Hatcher ( Netflix )**
- Responsible for rigging the Old Man and various other supported Monsters and Humans. As well as a wide range of costume changes throughout the season

**Tarzan and Jane ( Netflix )**
- Responsible for body and facial rigging Kala ( Tarzan's Mother ) and other Ape Family members.

**Top Wing ( Nickelodeon )**
- Completed the rigs for about one third of the cast, as well as vehicles, props and sets.
- I was also able to creat a few tools using python to speed up aspects of the setup and help keep it more consistent.
