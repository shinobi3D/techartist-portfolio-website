      <description>Color Changer is an updated version of a mel script I&amp;rsquo;ve been using in my workflow. I also took this as a challenge to build a gui using cmds. You also now have the ability to easily change the color on the shape of the control.&#xA;Github:</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website. This is my first attempt at building a Hugo site. The experience has been quite empowering and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of tools along the way. Its great how far web building tools have come along, I&amp;rsquo;d encourge any tech artist to give it a try.&#xA;Now that the setup is done, let the content flow! Sit tight, relax and look around. Hopefully you can find something of value here.</description>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to create my own book prop rig, but was never really tasked with doing so when I was on productions. Usually it would be a simple book, that never had to open or be interacted with. I never got to flex the rigging chops, but now that I have the time I&amp;rsquo;m making it a point.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve researched all the best book rigs i could find, and will be trying to mimic behaviour and features that I think are best.</description>
