      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to create my own book prop rig, but was never really tasked with doing so when I was on productions. Usually it would be a simple book, that never had to open or be interacted with. I never got to flex the rigging chops, but now that I have the time I&amp;rsquo;m making it a point.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve researched all the best book rigs i could find, and will be trying to mimic behaviour and features that I think are best.</description>
