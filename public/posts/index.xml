      <description>Color Changer is an updated python version of a mel script(edmxColorChanger.mel) I&amp;rsquo;ve been using in my workflow. I also took this as a challenge to build a gui using cmds. I also added the ability to easily change the color on the shape of the control.&#xA;Download Link: GitHub/Rig-No-Jutsu</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website. This is my first attempt at building a Hugo site. The experience has been quite empowering and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of tools along the way. Its great how far web building tools have come along, I&amp;rsquo;d encourge any tech artist to give it a try.&#xA;Now that the setup is done, let the content flow! Sit tight, relax and look around. Hopefully you can find something of value here.</description>
