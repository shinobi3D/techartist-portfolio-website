      <description>Download Link: GitHub/Rig-No-Jutsu&#xA;About I created this script during produciton to speed up the process of setting limits. It helps you avoid having to go to the attribute editor and enabling each channel and setting the value. Far to many steps for my liking. This is much faster. I also plan on adding export/import functionality in the future.&#xA;How To Use Set Set Limit Select a control object and positon or rotate in space( preferably one axis at a time).</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website. This is my first attempt at building a Hugo site. The experience has been quite empowering and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of tools along the way. Its great how far web building tools have come along, I&amp;rsquo;d encourge any tech artist to give it a try.&#xA;Now that the setup is done, let the content flow! Sit tight, relax and look around. Hopefully you can find something of value here.</description>
