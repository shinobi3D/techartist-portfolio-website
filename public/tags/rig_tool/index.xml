      <description>Download Link: GitHub/Rig-No-Jutsu&#xA;About I created this script during produciton to speed up the process of setting limits. It helps you avoid having to go to the attribute editor and enabling each channel and setting the value. Far to many steps for my liking. This is much faster. I also plan on adding export/import functionality in the future.&#xA;How To Use &amp;ndash; Set &amp;ndash; Set Limit Select a control object and positon or rotate in space( preferably one axis at a time).</description>
